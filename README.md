## Assignment

This assignment is about themes, styles, and attributes. The goal is to make the app in the repository as professional-looking as you can. Please use [Material Design](https://material.io/).

The starter code is an app called **NASA_Apod**. Apod stands for [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). This is a collection of images provided by NASA with an [api](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Astronomy-Picture-of-the-Day-API/ez2w-t8ua) to retrieve the Astronomy Picture of the Day as well as archived pictures for previous days. The api can be accessed with just the key 'DEMO_KEY'. No personal api key is required.

For this assignment:

- Use a material design theme, e.g. ```Theme.MaterialComponents```
- Use a layout suitable for images, e.g. a ```GridLayout```.
- Use a color scheme that matches the astronomy theme of the app.
- Make sure the app looks great for portrait and landscape orientation.
- Use a good label on the toolbar (Apod is kind of hard to understand).
- Be creative. Make the app pretty. Use your own ideas. The app doesn't have to look like the picture on the right.
